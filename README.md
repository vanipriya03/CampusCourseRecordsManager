Evolution of java
1995: Java 1.0 released by Sun Microsystems

2004: J2SE 5.0 introduced generics, autoboxing, enums

2014: Java SE 8 introduced Lambdas and Stream API

2018: Java SE 11 (LTS) with modularization

2021: Java SE 17 (LTS) with sealed classes

2023: Java SE 21 (LTS) with virtual threads

JDK/JRE/JVM Explanation
JDK (Java Development Kit)
It is a complete development package for Java programmers. It contains compiler (javac) to convert Java code to bytecode. It contains Tools (java, jar, javadoc) for development. It contains Libraries and development files. It is used for development Java applications.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
It is an environment to run Java applications. It contains JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It contains Core libraries and classes. It contains Support files. It is used to execute Java programs (end-users need this).

JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
It is a Virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It loads bytecode. It verifies code safety. It executes code line by line. It provides memory management (garbage collection). It makes Java platform-independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere).

Windows Installation Steps
Download JDK 21 from Oracle website
Run installer and follow setup instructions
Set JAVA_HOME environment variable to JDK installation path
Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to system PATH
Verify installation with java -version and javac -version
(See screenshots/java-install-verification.png)

Eclipse Setup Steps
Download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
Extract and run eclipse.exe
Configure Installed JREs to point to JDK 21
Import project as Existing Projects into Workspace
Set run configuration for CCRMApplication main class
(See screenshots/eclipse-setup.png)
